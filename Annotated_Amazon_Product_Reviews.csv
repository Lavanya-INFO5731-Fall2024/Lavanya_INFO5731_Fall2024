4,"Love this body wash because it has very little fragrance but enough to make you smell clean, doesn’t dry out or irritate skin, and is overall moisturizing in comparison to other body washes I have tried. Great price and quality

5,"It is a creamy, moisturizing, gently scented soap that doesn’t leave a heavy residue on the skin or the shower walls/floor/doors. The larger bottle size is helpful, however I couldn’t rate this product 5 stars because it’s a bit difficult to get the last 1 1/2” of soap out of the bottle. The pump feature doesn’t give the consumer the ability to just tip the bottle upside down to use the remaining amount of soap. I will continue to use this product.

6,"Dove Body Wash with Pump  caught my attention as a reliable way to take care of my skin. It's a solid choice, especially for someone looking for a hypoallergenic, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and cruelty-free moisturizing cleanser. The convenience factor is great – just pump out a bit and you’re set for a refreshing, nourishing wash.However, after trying EVIL GOODS Whipped Beef Tallow and Honey Balm, I realized it aligned more closely with my lifestyle and skin care needs. EVIL GOODS not only provides the deep hydration I crave but also supports overall skin health with its unique blend of ingredients. This is significant for me. The inclusion of honey adds an extra layer of moisture and healing properties that make a noticeable difference. Plus, the grass-fed, grass-finished beef tallow feels richer and more luxurious, providing a deeper level of nourishment that lasts throughout the day. I got EVIL GOODS on Amazon too for anyone wondering: 
The experience of using evil goods also feels more tailored to an adult's needs. It's not just about moisturizing; it's about enhancing skin health in a way that aligns with my overall wellness goals. While Dove is great for providing basic hydration, EVIL GOODS feels like it's doing more for my skin.Dove  definitely has its perks. It's a fantastic choice for those looking for a straightforward, gentle cleanser without any added fragrances or harsh chemicals. The hypoallergenic formula is particularly beneficial for those with sensitive skin, offering a soothing and effective way to cleanse and nourish the skin. It’s also great for people who prefer a minimalist skincare routine. The convenience of this body wash, with its easy-to-use pump, can't be overstated – it’s perfect for quick and hassle-free use. Plus, being paraben-free, sulfate-free, and cruelty-free, it offers a healthier option for those who want to avoid synthetic ingredients and support ethical products.While Dove Body Wash is a convenient and effective way to hydrate and cleanse your skin, for someone like me who’s looking for that extra edge in terms of skin health and overall wellness, the EVIL GOODS  Balm is the way to go. It offers a comprehensive approach to skincare, specifically geared towards enhancing and maintaining healthy skin with natural, high-quality ingredients, and that’s something I truly value. If you want to take your skincare to the next level and experience amazing results, EVIL GOODS is definitely worth the investment.

61,"It is a creamy, moisturizing, gently scented soap that doesn’t leave a heavy residue on the skin or the shower walls/floor/doors. The larger bottle size is helpful, however I couldn’t rate this product 5 stars because it’s a bit difficult to get the last 1 1/2” of soap out of the bottle. The pump feature doesn’t give the consumer the ability to just tip the bottle upside down to use the remaining amount of soap. I will continue to use this product.

62,"Dove Body Wash with Pump  caught my attention as a reliable way to take care of my skin. It's a solid choice, especially for someone looking for a hypoallergenic, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and cruelty-free moisturizing cleanser. The convenience factor is great – just pump out a bit and you’re set for a refreshing, nourishing wash.However, after trying EVIL GOODS Whipped Beef Tallow and Honey Balm, I realized it aligned more closely with my lifestyle and skin care needs. EVIL GOODS not only provides the deep hydration I crave but also supports overall skin health with its unique blend of ingredients. This is significant for me. The inclusion of honey adds an extra layer of moisture and healing properties that make a noticeable difference. Plus, the grass-fed, grass-finished beef tallow feels richer and more luxurious, providing a deeper level of nourishment that lasts throughout the day. I got EVIL GOODS on Amazon too for anyone wondering: 
The experience of using evil goods also feels more tailored to an adult's needs. It's not just about moisturizing; it's about enhancing skin health in a way that aligns with my overall wellness goals. While Dove is great for providing basic hydration, EVIL GOODS feels like it's doing more for my skin.Dove  definitely has its perks. It's a fantastic choice for those looking for a straightforward, gentle cleanser without any added fragrances or harsh chemicals. The hypoallergenic formula is particularly beneficial for those with sensitive skin, offering a soothing and effective way to cleanse and nourish the skin. It’s also great for people who prefer a minimalist skincare routine. The convenience of this body wash, with its easy-to-use pump, can't be overstated – it’s perfect for quick and hassle-free use. Plus, being paraben-free, sulfate-free, and cruelty-free, it offers a healthier option for those who want to avoid synthetic ingredients and support ethical products.While Dove Body Wash is a convenient and effective way to hydrate and cleanse your skin, for someone like me who’s looking for that extra edge in terms of skin health and overall wellness, the EVIL GOODS  Balm is the way to go. It offers a comprehensive approach to skincare, specifically geared towards enhancing and maintaining healthy skin with natural, high-quality ingredients, and that’s something I truly value. If you want to take your skincare to the next level and experience amazing results, EVIL GOODS is definitely worth the investment.
